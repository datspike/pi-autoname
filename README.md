  <strong>AI-powered semantic session naming for Pi.</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Automatically name sessions after the first dialogue, periodically re-name as the conversation evolves, and regenerate on demand with <code>/autoname</code>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  <code>pi install npm:pi-autoname</code>
</p>

## ✨ What it does

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| First dialogue completes | Automatically generates a semantic session name |
| Conversation continues | Silently re-names every 10 minutes (configurable) |
| Session topic drifts | Name updates to reflect the new focus |
| Run `/autoname` | Manually regenerate from recent context |
| AI naming fails | Falls back to smart text extraction (up to 30 characters) |

## 🚀 Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-autoname
```

**Works out of the box.** No configuration needed — uses your current session's model by default.

### Pi compatibility

The published package requires Pi API packages in the tested range `>=0.79.10 <0.82.0`:

- `@earendil-works/pi-ai` `>=0.79.10 <0.82.0`
- `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` `>=0.79.10 <0.82.0`

CI checks the minimum supported version (`0.79.10`) directly from the lockfile. Versions below `0.79.10` and future major/minor versions outside the upper bound are intentionally rejected by npm.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Config file is **auto-generated** on first use at `~/.pi/agent/pi-autoname.json`:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "model": "",
  "fallbackModels": [],
  "cooldownMinutes": 10,
  "debug": false,
  "respectManualName": false
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Set to `false` to disable AI naming |
| `model` | string | _(session model)_ | Primary model (`provider/modelId`). Empty = use session model |
| `fallbackModels` | string[] | `[]` | Additional models to try if primary fails |
| `cooldownMinutes` | number | `10` | Minutes between periodic re-names |
| `debug` | boolean | `false` | Enable debug logging |
| `respectManualName` | boolean | `false` | When `false` (default), pi-autoname owns session naming: automatic naming runs on first dialogue and periodically, and may overwrite a name set via `/name` or `/autoname`. Set to `true` for the legacy behavior of treating a user-issued rename as sticky. |

### Example: Model fallback chain

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "model": "minimax-cn/MiniMax-M2.7",
  "fallbackModels": [
    "xiaomi-token-plan-cn/mimo-v2-omni"
  ],
  "cooldownMinutes": 10
}
```

This tries models in order: `MiniMax-M2.7` → `mimo-v2-omni` → session model.

## 🏗️ How it works

### Automatic naming

```
first user message
        ↓
first assistant reply finishes
        ↓
AI generates semantic session name
        ↓
setSessionName(name)
```

### Periodic re-naming

```
agent_end event (new message processed)
        ↓
cooldown passed? (10 min default)
        ↓
AI generates new name from recent context
        ↓
name changed? → silently update
name same? → skip
```

### Model fallback chain

```
primary model (from config)
        ↓ failed?
fallback models (from config)
        ↓ failed?
session model (automatic)
        ↓ failed?
smart text extraction (no AI)
```

### Manual naming

```bash
/autoname
```

Regenerates the session name from recent conversation context. Useful when you want to force an immediate rename.

### Built-in `/name` is largely redundant

Pi's native command still works:

```bash
/name My custom title
```

However, with `pi-autoname` installed, the periodic re-naming (`cooldownMinutes` default 10 min) will likely overwrite your `/name` change on the next `agent_end`. This is the **default** behavior (`respectManualName: false`) — pi-autoname owns the session name.

- For a one-shot rename that pi-autoname will then take over again: use `/name`.
- To force a re-name from the current conversation right now: use `/autoname`.
- To opt out of pi-autoname ever overwriting your `/name`: set `respectManualName: true` in the config.

#### `/name` grace period

When you `/name` a session, pi-autoname detects the out-of-band change on the next `agent_end` and **resets the rename cooldown to now**. That gives your `/name` choice a full `cooldownMinutes` window before the next periodic rename is allowed to consider overwriting it. If the conversation topic changes earlier, the periodic rename will still run normally — `/name` is a grace period, not a lock.

## 🔐 Privacy note

`pi-autoname` sends a short, recent conversation excerpt to the selected naming model. Before sending, it redacts common secret patterns such as API keys, bearer tokens, AWS access keys, private keys, and `*_TOKEN` / `*_SECRET` / `*_PASSWORD` environment assignments. If the AI call fails and the user text contained a detected secret, the local fallback name is skipped to avoid turning secrets into session names.

## 🌍 Locale support

The language is detected from the first non-empty system variable in this order: `PI_LOCALE` → `LC_ALL` → `LANG`. The prompt currently has explicit instructions for Chinese (`zh`), Japanese (`ja`), Korean (`ko`), and Russian (`ru`) locales. Unknown or unsupported locales use English as the prompt fallback, while valid generated names are accepted from any Unicode writing system.
